# Sonya_VBA_Macros
2017 - 2018 (Developed for Project Financial Tool for Johnson &amp; Johnson- GenSight)

At GenSight, we provide highly configurable software solutions to portfolio management for a range of clients including Johnson &  Johnson,
Pfizer, GSK, Cococola, Asahi, AkzoNobel, Victrex, NEG and many more. One of the advantages of GenSight is that we provide a comprehensive,
two-way integration with Microsoft Excel, which has been proven to be very popular among finance professionals. These Excel documents are
programmed by software developers at GenSight and are known as Dynamic Documents.

One of my major projects at GenSight was building upon the "Project Financial Tool" - a dynamic document for Johnson & Johnson. Some of 
the tasks involved include:
•  Extreme Value & Invalid Entry Detection
•  Entry-Based Suggestion Feature (inc. typos and abbrev)
•  Data Consistency Feature to ensure that the NTS, NTSLC, and GP fields for a year, are either all filled in or left completely blank for each SKU
•  Proposed a "validation sheet" where all problems are raised with links to navigate users to the issue
•  Data Shift Feature allowing users to shift data on changing the ship-to-trade-date
•  Developed test cases and unit tests using methodologies inc. equivalence partitioning, regression & stress testing
•  Developed complex Excel formulae to automate financial calculations and consolidate data
•  Improved performance via code optimisation to handle larger sets of data
•  The tool is now a critical tool for the finance team and portfolio managers at J&J
•  Validation system has made users less reliant on GenSight's support team.

In the aim to make re-usable and optimised functions, I decided to make my own set of functions to deal with some common problems VBA 
developers may face when developing new functionalities. These re-usable macros have been used in other Excel Dynamic Documents at GenSight.

# Sonya_VBA_Macros
Complex, Re-Usable, Performance-Optimised VBA Functions (2017 - 2019)
These functions were developed whilst my time at GenSight, where I worked on the Project Financial Tool for Johnson & Johnson.
These functions have been used in other Dynamic Documents such as Sales Entry, Capex and Investment Entry for the client, Baxter.
